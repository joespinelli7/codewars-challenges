// Your task is to give the number of total values for the odd terms of the sequence up to the n-th term (included).
// (The number n (of n-th term) will be given as a positive integer). The values 1 (one) is the only that is
// duplicated in the sequence and should be counted only once.\
// Examples:
// count_odd_pentaFib(5) => 1, because the terms up to 5 are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8 (only 1 is odd and counted once)
// count_odd_pentaFib(10) => 3
