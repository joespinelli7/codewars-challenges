// Write a program that among the given numbers  finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position
// of this number. Keep in mind that your task is to help solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of the elements
// start from 1 (not 0).
// Examples:
// iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even
// iqTest("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
