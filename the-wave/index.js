// Your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave. You will be
// passed a string and you must return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person standing up.
// The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty. If the character in the string is whitespace then
// pass over it as if it was an empty seat.
// Example:
// wave("hello") => ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]

function wave(str){
  
}
