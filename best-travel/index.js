// The function chooseBestSum will take as parameters t (maximum sum of distances, integer >= 0), k (number of
// towns to visit, k >= 1) and ls (list of distances, all distances are positive or null integers and this list
// has at least one element). The function returns the "best" sum ie the biggest possible sum of k distances less
// than or equal to the given limit t, if that sum exists, or otherwise null.
// Examples:
// ts = [50, 55, 56, 57, 58] chooseBestSum(163, 3, ts) => 163
// xs = [50] chooseBestSum(163, 3, xs) => null
// ys = [91, 74, 73, 85, 73, 81, 87] chooseBestSum(230, 3, ys) => 228

function chooseBestSum(t, k, ls) {
